# Port-scanner-with-c
### This C language code is used to scan the open ports on a specific range of IP addresses. The program takes three command line arguments: the IP address to be scanned, the start port, and the end port in the scan range. The program then iterates through the specified range of ports and calls the "scan_port" function to check if the port is open or closed.
